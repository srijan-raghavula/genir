# genir
Photorealistic rendering software

## Why genir?
- It's a web application currently running on local machine for the [problem statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uTu2Z6X_ADfhlfqnYkcwudpIMVXQRUYnd9d0YqCudDc/edit?tab=t.0) of [Hack2Future](https://www.hack2future.tech)

## How's it implemented?
- The part of the current flow is [this](https://excalidraw.com/#json=vHwWsMx8q2tQ4pmw--EWk,aMVylH5X9ci8uifg4iGiiA)
- Frontend is being made in a separate repo by [Karthik](https://github.com/Karthik-Alakanti) over [here](https://github.com/Karthik-Alakanti/hack2future).
- Rest will be done in this repository. This reposity is not the final application and will only contain pieces of the puzzle. They will be assembled in another repository as needed.
- The individual parts are made to be standalone like plug and play for this particular application. More of a functional approach, [black box method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing) in simple.
